# Move/resize windows on grid #

It's easy to place 2 windows side by side in GNOME, you just drag one window to the left side, another on the right side.

But the question is: what if I have 3 windows?

I want to place one on the left, another on the upper-right, the other on the bottom-right. Dragging windows to the corners doesn't work.

The answer is to use the [gTile](https://github.com/gTile/gTile) GNOME extension.

Enable this extension and hit `Super+Enter` !
