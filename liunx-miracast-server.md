## Troubleshooting

If you cannot connect to miraclecast, run

```bash
sudo miracle-wifid --log-level trace
```

to show debug information. And if the error is described as

```
ERROR: supplicant: HUP on dhcp-comm socket on p2p-wlo1-1 (supplicant_group_comm_fn() in ../../../src/wifi/wifid-supplicant.c:247)
```

try 

```bash
sudo miracle-dhcp --netdev <your_interface>
```

In my case, the command failed with error:

```
ERROR: dhcp: execution of ip-binary (/bin/ip) not allowed: No such file or directory (parse_argv() in ../../../src/dhcp/dhcp.c:877)
```

I ran

```bash
which ip
```

it prints

```
/usr/sbin/ip
```

So the solution was

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/sbin/ip /bin/ip
```
